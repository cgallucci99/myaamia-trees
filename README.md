#Myaamia Trees Web App
This is a website that covers many of the trees used by the Miami tribe that occur on
Miami University's campus. It is a project for IDS 259 taught by Dr. Cameron Shriver.
The tree map on the home page can be used to get an overview of where all of the trees
can be found. The trees section can be used to see pictures and descriptions of all
of the different trees.
